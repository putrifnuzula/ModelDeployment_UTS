# Model Deployment_UTS
This project involves data preprocessing and developing a predictive model for churn rate using XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, followed by deploying the best-performing model on Streamlit.

# Objective:
- Drop irrelevant columns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and split the data.
- Preprocess the data by encoding non-numeric columns and filling the missing values in the 'CreditScore' column.
- Check for outliers after splitting the data to ensure it's clean.
- Train models using XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms.
- Compare the performance of both models, resulting in XGBoost performing better.
- Save the best model in pickle format for deployment.
- Organize the training process using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Deploy the final model on Streamlit.
